	<div class="question">What years did you attend ITB?</div>

2009-2012
		<div class="question">What did you study at ITB?</div>

Creative Digital Media

<div class="question">How has your degree at ITB helped you to get to where you are now in your career?</div>

Creative Digital Media in ITB helped me gain a solid understanding of how to handle a project from concept to completion. I found the continuous assessment model very beneficial as deadlines are a big part of day to day tasks within the media industry. My social and communication skills developed greatly due to team assignments & presentations. I learned to take responsibility for myself and my team, not only in work, but in my personal life too. Accepting, and utilising feedback from teammates and presentation panels to my advantage. This led me to a new level of professional growth. 

		<div class="question">Where do you work now and what is your job title?</div>

I currently work at Clear Designs as Head Designer / Studio Manager, I am responsible for handling all aspects of the Creative Design process. My duties include managing and delivering on tight deadlines, project management, liaising with customers, staff training & support.
