<div class="faunapartone">The Blanchardstwon area was originally called 'Buzzardstown' because of &nbsp;how popular the Buzzard bird was around the area. The name Blanchardstown comes from the Blanchard family, who were granted their estate some time between 1250 and 1260. 
Much of present-day Blanchardstown was once covered by dense forest, which was known as the Great Scaldwood. The forest streched from the River Tolka to beyond Coolmine. It was home to wolves and wild boar, which were hunted by the local gentry. Following years of war and rebellion during which the number of hunters waned, the wolf population grew to such an extent that it posed a danger to local people and livestock.</div>
	
<div class="faunapartwo">
 There still remains ancient hedgerows across the landscape of ITB that act as indications as to what the landscape used to look like. The locals began a campaign for a third level insitution in Blanchardstown. Before ITB, there was no third-level education institutes in the Blanchardstown area. ITB was built away from the shopping centre where there was fields of green and lots of room for expansion and growth.   </div>
